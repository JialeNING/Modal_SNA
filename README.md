# Modal_SNA
Simulation numérique aléatoire (SNA) autour des évènements rares

In this project, we have studied the stochastic block model and implemented the sprectral clustering to identify clusters in the data.
We have also studied the probability that certain points are not correctly classified. We have used the importance sampling and the splitting method.
